## About the project 
The main idea behind this project was to create simple memory game without any using tutorials that's describing how to create game like that.

The design of this website was inspired by [Hello Roman's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq8XmOMtrUCb8FcFHQEd8_g/videos) 'CSS cookbook' series. <br>
The layout was created by me, you can check out my Figma project [here](https://www.figma.com/file/CbZNbcfRPRzG6hyYCM24Np/memo?node-id=0%3A686).
